Natural Resources are Plants, Trees, Rocks, Crystal and other Objects on the Map, that can be Harvested.

They appear either all over the map, or only in specific Biomes.

Natural Resources are the most Important part in Building a Tower, but also used for Fixing Disabled Towers and buying rare components.

Harvesting

There are Two Ways to Harvest Natural Resources:
- Destructive Harvest
- Collect

Some Resources like Stone and Crystal needs to be Destructively harvested, meaning shooting at it until it breaks. these Resources have Health points and can be damaged by any Damage (including enemies by accident).

Other Resources Can be collected by standing In front of it and Pressing the Interact Key. These will regrow after some time (Plants, Trees turning to stumps). 
They can also be destroyed, but wont respawn.
(Either Collect now, wait for a bit and collect later again, or Collect, then Destroy for getting a lot of resources Instantly, but no more after that)
