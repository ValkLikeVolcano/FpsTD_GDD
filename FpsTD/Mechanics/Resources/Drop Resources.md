Drop Resources are Gold, Hide and Others.

They Can be gathered by killing monsters, which drop a set amount of Generic Drop Resources, aswell as a random amount of Special Resources when fitting the Monster Style 
(e.g. Tree Mob dropping Wood).

Bigger Mobs and Bosses can carry even rarer Items (Legendary component) or Resources.
