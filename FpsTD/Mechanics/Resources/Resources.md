Resources are Required to Purchase and Build Towers and Components.

There are Two Types of Resources:
[[Natural Resources]]: appear on the Map, can be Harvested and Collected.
[[Drop Resources]]: are only obtained from killing enemies, or at special points of the Map 
(e.g. Hidden Chest).

Collected Resources are added to the Players [[Inventory]] (No Limitation), and dropped or used from there.

When a player is Killed, they drop 1/2 of their Resources, the Rest is lost. (Rare Resources are Always Dropped)

Dropped Resources are Cleared with the beginning of a Wave. Resources dropped in-between waves (prep time) will remain until the next Wave.
