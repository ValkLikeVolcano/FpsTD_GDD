[[Why Perks]]

Perks have the design of medieval coins, with a symbol displaying the Type/Use of the Perk (Ability, Ultimate Ability, Stats, Tower etc.).

In the end of every Wave, every Player gets to choose between one of 3 random Perks Displayed.

Perks are Categorized by a rarity System (Bronze, Silver, Gold) which decides in what wave they can show up (Gold every 5 waves) and how rare they are to show up.

The First Draw of Perks Consists only of the Class Specific Pool. (Immediately demonstrating the difference between Classes)

Perks can affect the following game features:
- Player Stats
- Player Weapon (new Weapon/ Upgrade Existing)
- Player [[Abilities]] (new Ability(Max 3)/ Upgrade Existing)
- New Tower
- Tower Stats
- Enemy Debuffs
- [[Consumable Perks]] effects or objects (Max 1)
- Vendor bonuses

etc.
