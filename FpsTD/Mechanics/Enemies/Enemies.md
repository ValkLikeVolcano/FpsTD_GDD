The Enemies play a Significant role in the Game, and should behave like a bulk of Unintelligent Monsters (orienting movement along paths, avoiding each other...).

There are 6 Types of Enemy Behaviors:
- Passive (Rush to Objective, Ignore everything else)
- Passive Neutral (act Neutral, when Player attacks and isn't too far away, attack Player)
- Aggressive Neutral (act Neutral, when Player or Tower attacks, focus on attacker)
- Aggressive (attack everything in range, else walk to Objective)

- Guarding (Defending/ Patrolling area, attack when in range)
- Player Aggressive (Always hunt down Players when in range, else Patrol, avoid Towers)


The Enemy Types are split into [[Generic Enemies]] and [[Special Enemies]].

Waves are mainly build from Generics, and occasionally specials.

Specials are mainly used for biomes, boss fights and other important events.
