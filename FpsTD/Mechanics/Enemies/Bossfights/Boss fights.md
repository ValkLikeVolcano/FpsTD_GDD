The 3 Boss fights in a normal Game loop are meant to mix up the play cycle and style, aswell as giving the player a certain pressure and goal to work towards.

Boss fights occur at Halftime (wave 15), in wave 25, and after wave 30.
These Waves are fundamentally different from the other waves, so don't confuse them with strong Enemies!

Boss fights are meant to be rather long lasting than quick Shootdowns.

The fights after wave 30 are called the [[Main Boss fights]] and provide the Biggest challenge in the game, really putting the Executed Strategy to the Test.

The in between boss fights are called [[Micro Boss fights]] and are not as Devastating as the Main Boss.

The three boss fights will be selected randomly at the start of the match. 
(not each individual but a bundle of three to assure different and fitting boss fights in one match, aswell as letting "veteran" players know what the next and final boss will be after the first one to strategize beforehand)
