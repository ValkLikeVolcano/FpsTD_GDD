The Main boss fight is the main Event of the Match, thirsting all the resources out of the players.
It can be more destructive and game changing as there is nothing coming after (just like death).

Main Boss Fights should be a longer event with multiple phases best case.

Structure

Type 1:
Large slow Enemy, can shield himself and spawn minions around him.
Disabling/Corrupting Towers, blocking Player abilities.
Keeps distance from Objective (far range attacks, summoned minions deal damage to Obj).


Type 2:
Giant Siege Engine tower With Enemy army spawning on the map. One shot deals massive damage to the Objective.
Players have to approach and destroy it while also keep an eye on enemies approaching the objective Directly.

Type 3:
Goldnet Spawns and thanks to his great multiplayer script, the server Crashes and the players are to blame for it.


Phase Ideas:

Players get teleported into closed arena, forced to Defeat a Large Enemy to get back.
(focus on fps aspect)

Boss spawns in large amount of enemies, disables abilities (and weapons?) of the players. Trying to upgrade towers and take care of disabled ones, collecting resources from enemies killed by towers. (focus on Tower defense aspect)

Boss Soul/Heart/Energy gets separated and distributed over the map. Players have to find and destroy them to enable the next phase. Boss is invincible, still and acting passive during that phase (only basic Enemy spawns).
(focus on exploration aspect)


Interesting, funny and original Main Boss Idea:
After wave 30, one random Player gets selected as the Demon Lord. This player will lose all his progress and respawn as demon lord with his abilities and weapons. the Player now has to try to fight against the other three and destroy the Objective.
This Obviously sounds Ridiculous as it was coop the entire time until then, so why shouldn't the player just let himself be killed?
To make this work, first of all there needs to be a Good reason for players to win (unlocks etc.), maybe some Achievements.

May Design some functional version of this Later :D
