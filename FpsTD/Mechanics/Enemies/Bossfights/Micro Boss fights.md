Being a smaller version of the Main boss fight, micro boss fights still change up the gameplay in various ways depending on the selected boss.

Basic Structure 

Type 1:
One or Several Unique Boss Monsters show up, equipped with certain abilities. E.g.:
- Providing strong Buffs to Enemies/ Debuffs to Players
- Disabling or messing with towers
- Teleporting Players
etc.


Type 2:
A Cart loaded with resources spawning somewhere, moving along a road to the objective. Enemies appear to attack it. Players have to defend it.

Cart is Marked on the HUD.

2 Outcomes:
- Players defend Cart till it reaches the Objective, getting a bunch of Resources (Cart despawns, dropping resources)
- Enemies Destroy cart, spawning big Monster on Location. Monster Drops Resources when Defeated

Type 3:
Enemy nests (spawner) appear all over the map.
The wave doesn't end until all the spawners plus their spawned Enemies are defeated.
These enemies will not drop any Resources to prevent Farming.
Once a Spawner is Destroyed, a big Enemy appears in its stead, dropping resources on death.

Spawners are Marked on the HUD.
