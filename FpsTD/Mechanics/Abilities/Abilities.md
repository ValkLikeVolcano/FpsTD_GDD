Perks of the type Ability are mostly Class specific.
At the Beginning, the Players start without any Abilities.

There Are Ability and Ultimate Ability Perks.
Ability perks can be assigned to the 3 Ability Slots, and swapped around in the [[Menu]] (Swap the E Ability with the Shift Ability).

When All Ability-slots are full and the Player selects another ability perk, he will be able to choose which one to ditch for the new.
