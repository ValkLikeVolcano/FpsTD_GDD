Waves are the Progressing part of the game.
witch each wave, the thread should become larger but also with a certain randomness to it for variation and replayability.

there are 31 Waves In Total, with 15, 25 and 31 excluded as Boss fights.

Each wave has a random range for the amount of enemies that can spawn, aswell as a pool for what types can spawn. The spawn positions are Randomly set aswell.

In-between waves there is a few seconds (30) of Preparation time until the next Wave.
the end of a wave is determined when the last wave spawned enemy dies or a Timer runs out (mainly to prevent the game from breaking when a enemy gets stuck somewhere).
