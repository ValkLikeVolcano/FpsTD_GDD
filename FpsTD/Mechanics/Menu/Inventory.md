The Inventory is a system to store Purchased Towers, Components and Resources.
It Consists of 1 Tower Slot, 3 Component slots (type) and one slot for every resource.

Players can drop things out of their inventory and pick it up again by walking over it.
This allows for quickly sharing resources of an explorer and a defender who uses the resources to buy towers for example.
