I removed the need of Energy for the towers to Operate, seemed like too much.

Tower Build/Upgrade Loop:
- Purchase [[Tower Commission]] from Vendor (Gold/Enemy Drops)
- Place Commission on available Plot
- Insert Required Resources into the Plot (with blueprint silhouette of the tower)
- Once enough resources are in, the tower takes some time to be constructed
- Purchase Components from the vendor for Resources
- Insert Components into the build tower to fill the upgrade bar
- Once enough Components are in, the tower takes some time to be upgraded (disabled)
