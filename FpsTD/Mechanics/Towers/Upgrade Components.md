[[Why Upgrade Components]]

There are 3 types of Components (Generic Component, Rare Component, Nvidia Gpu or Legendary Component)

Generic Comps can be purchased by everyone and apply to every tower, adding 1 Component to the total amount. Rare comps add 10 Components to the total, and legendary's add 100 comps to the tower.

Legendary Components cant be brought but can be gained by big enemy Drops.

Each tower has One Upgrade path and needs a certain amount of components to go through with the Upgrade.
