Towers have Health Points that can be lowered by Enemies and Players.

When the Health points reach 0, the Tower is DISABLED, but can be repaired with resources (depending on tower and level).

To get rid of a Tower (e.g. to free a plot for another tower), Players can shoot the tower 5 times in its Disabled state to destroy it without any compensation.

Why?

The Disabling of towers removes frustration when a good Tower gets destroyed by Enemies, and preventing/ Reducing the snowball effect that happens when too many enemies are present and destroy towers, which leaves the Players with even less Firepower.
