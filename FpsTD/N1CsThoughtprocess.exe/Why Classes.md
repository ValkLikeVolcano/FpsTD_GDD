The Classes combined with the Perks get rid of the "Hero" based design.

We can focus on making class Specific Towers, perks and more to allow for a variety of playstyles without having to design and implement various "Heroes" with specific abilities.

"Heroes" offered one certain playstyle with Consistency which gets boring over time and is also a big Hussle to Implement.

They did have the advantage of adding extremely specific abilities and attaching the player to the character through personality etc.

Classes only determine a direction of playstyle, but the actual experience differs every time through a variety of random perks.

We can add more classes if we have ideas for specific towers and perks later, which will Immediately allow for a ton of new ways to experience the Game.
