Plots fix a bunch of design difficulties that came with the free place system:

- Placing everywhere could cause unforeseen behavior and glitches

- By Limiting the placement options, we effectively give the game more Strategy, as the players can no longer just place a bunch of towers in front of the gate next to each other without much thinking, rendering the use of strategies unnecessary

- The Solution is allowing more balancing of the game through the amount and position of the Plots

- Instead of a Style Unfitting Blueprint like Place mode the plot can be brought and populated in the shop

- A tower placed on a plot cant be sold but only destroyed, to lock the player in their decision

Issues: Could Feel limiting (playtest) Especially with the otherwise open first person style
