Upgrade Components are an Item used to Upgrade Compatible towers.

This approach of upgrading Towers has several advantages compared to Usual upgrades for towers in TD games:

- The Components are not bound to a Certain Tower but Work for a variety/ all of them, removing the need of lots of Individual Items with names
- adds a layer of strategy and reward when enough comps are gathered

Why Items in the First place?

The Upgrading through Items approach requires the players to return to the vendor / objective, making sure they don't just run of and not playing around the objective.

We want the players to mainly play around the objective, as there the most action is happening, we can focus on that area of the map, keep the feel of an tower defense game.

Each tower has One Upgrade path and needs a certain amount of components to go through with the Upgrade. This allows Players to put comps into a tower over time, really showing the progress Instead of dealing with it through 1 click.
