INFO PANEL

When The Player moves the Crosshair over an Game relevant Actor (Tower, Teammates, Enemies...)
a Widget displaying Information about the object is shown. 

Enemy => Name, Health Points, Buffs/Debuffs
Tower => Type, Level, Component amount, Resource amount (when building Tower), Health Points, Is Disabled?, Buffs/ Debuffs, (Kills?)
Player => Name, Class, Level, Health points
Resource => Name

Goal of the Info Panel is to effectively get rid of menus when wanting to Interact with Towers (now just look and click at Displayed Prompts to Insert Resources or Components). Also giving some basic Information about the Enemies and Players, to get a good overview of the Situation.

PROMPTS

When looking at an Object that can be interacted with, Prompt will show up, allowing the player to quickly Insert Resources and Components into a tower without entering a menu
