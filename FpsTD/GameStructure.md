The Players get to chose from (Initially) 4 [[Classes]] that come with a variety of playstyles/possibilities.

Damage and Healing is Indiscriminative, meaning Towers damage Players and Enemies, Heal affects Player and Enemies, Player can damage themselves and their Towers.
Towers and Enemies cant deal damage to their kind. Enemy heals can affect Players.
